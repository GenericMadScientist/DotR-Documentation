# Duelists of the Roses Documentation

This is where I plan to put technical information regarding the NTSC-U version
of Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses. This is in early days yet, so for now
you will probably want to peruse
[this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L_hkkhuF4C3miPzkiTSF_vPPOCov48kqNyhPqQBHTZQ).
I've accumulated enough information that working with the Google doc has become
incredibly inconvenient, hence the move to here.

These docs are created by using Doxygen on header files. The generated docs are
available at
[https://genericmadscientist.github.io/DotR-Documentation](https://genericmadscientist.github.io/DotR-Documentation).

I assume familiarity with the C programming language. For modding the game it
would also be useful to have the PS2 SDK docs and some knowledge of MIPS
assembly.

This page is not here to provide a user-friendly guide on modding the game. For
that purpose, the only publicly available tool I am aware of is
[yugioh-dor-deckedit](https://github.com/RenolY2/yugioh-dor-deckedit) by
RenolY2. My understanding is it allows you to modify enemy decks and the starter
decks, and you will have to grab PyQt yourself. I have no experience with it
though.

If you have anything to add (additional information, links to more tools, etc.)
feel free to send a pull request.
